Description: Game where you have to guess your opponent's secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs), check it out on Wikipedia. Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was -- whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.

You have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer's random code.
